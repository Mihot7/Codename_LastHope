# Codename LastHope

Codename LastHope is a re-write of MTOS (Mihot7's Text Operating System), as of right now, idk how I'll name it.




## Compatibility

We're working hard to restore core functionality of MTOS, as this might take a while, our goal is to restore atleast 80% features. We don't guarantee any compatibility with OG MTOS and Mihot 14 systems.
